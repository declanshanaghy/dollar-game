# Card Icon Prompts for AI Image Generation

> *"In the digital tapestry of our interface, each icon serves as a portal to deeper consciousness, a visual mantra guiding the seeker through the cosmic landscape of graph theory."* â€” Anonymous l33tc0dzr sipping a cortado

## Overview

This document contains prompts for generating new icons for the link cards at the bottom of the Dollar Game application. These prompts are designed for AI image generators to create icons that align with our "l33tc0dzr, l4tt3 drinking, hippy trousers architect" aesthetic.

Each icon should be:
- 256x256 pixels (can be scaled down as needed)
- Transparent background (PNG format)
- Visually distinct yet harmonious with each other
- Embodying both technical precision and bohemian sensibilities

## Icon 1: Documentation & Mathematical Foundation

**Current Icon:** ðŸ“š (Books emoji)

**Prompt:**

```
Create a stylized icon representing mathematical documentation with a bohemian-tech aesthetic. The icon should feature an ancient, leather-bound tome partially open with glowing graph theory diagrams and equations floating out from its pages. The book should have sacred geometry patterns embossed on its cover.

The floating elements should include:
- A small, elegant graph with vertices and edges
- Subtle dollar signs ($) integrated into the graph
- Wispy, ethereal connections between mathematical symbols

Color palette:
- Use rich earth tones (#5E4B36, #7D9471) for the book
- Jewel tones (#9B5DE5, #00BBF9) for the glowing mathematical elements
- Accent with #B8F84A for key highlights

The style should blend technical precision with hand-drawn, organic qualitiesâ€”as if a mathematician-monk created it during a meditation session at a third-wave coffee shop. Include subtle sacred geometry patterns in the background.

The overall composition should feel both academically rigorous and spiritually enlightened, with a hint of digital mysticism. The icon should be centered within a square frame with a transparent background.
```

## Icon 2: Video Explanation

**Current Icon:** ðŸŽ¬ (Clapperboard emoji)

**Prompt:**

```
Design an icon representing a video explanation of the Dollar Game with a l33tc0dzr-meets-bohemian aesthetic. Create a stylized vintage film projector that's projecting a beam of light containing graph theory elements.

The projector should have:
- A mix of steampunk and digital elements
- Small crystals or plants growing from its crevices
- Subtle circuit-like patterns etched into its surface

The projected beam should contain:
- A simplified, glowing graph with dollar signs at the vertices
- Flowing energy particles moving along the edges
- Mathematical symbols floating in the light

Color palette:
- Use warm sunset tones (#C17F58) for the projector body
- Cool tech blues (#00BBF9) for the projected light
- Accent with vibrant magenta (#FF00FF) for energy particles
- Highlight key elements with #F9C80E

The style should feel like analog technology meeting digital enlightenmentâ€”as if a tech-savvy shaman created a teaching tool for explaining graph theory. Include subtle binary code (1s and 0s) flowing along the edges of the projection.

The composition should balance technical precision with artistic expression, centered within a square frame with a transparent background.
```

## Icon 3: Graph Theory & Chip-Firing Games

**Current Icon:** ðŸ§© (Puzzle piece emoji)

**Prompt:**

```
Create an icon representing chip-firing games in graph theory with a fusion of mathematical precision and bohemian spirituality. Design a mandala-like circular graph where vertices are represented by small, glowing chakra points and edges flow between them like energy meridians.

The graph structure should:
- Form a perfect, symmetrical pattern reminiscent of sacred geometry
- Have 7-9 vertices arranged in a circular pattern
- Feature flowing, curved edges connecting the vertices

Include:
- Small coin/chip elements that appear to be in motion along the edges
- Subtle dollar signs integrated into the design
- A hint of code or mathematical notation around the outer ring

Color palette:
- Use deep meditation blue (#00BBF9) for the background aura
- Bright energy points (#00F5D4, #F9C80E) for the vertices
- Flowing gradients of purple to pink (#9B5DE5 to #F15BB5) for the edges
- Accent with #B8F84A for the moving chips/coins

The style should blend mathematical precision with mystical energy visualizationâ€”as if a graph theorist designed a meditation aid during a hackathon at a Burning Man camp. Include subtle, flowing particle effects along the edges to suggest energy movement.

The composition should feel both mathematically elegant and spiritually balanced, centered within a square frame with a transparent background.
```

## Implementation Notes

These icons will replace the current emoji icons in the link cards section at the bottom of the application. After the AI-generated icons are created:

1. Save the images in an appropriate format (PNG with transparency)
2. Update the card components to reference the new icon images
3. Adjust sizing and positioning as needed to maintain visual harmony

The new icons should maintain the essence of what the original emoji represented while elevating the visual experience to match our unique aesthetic.
